EDA TMDB 5000 Dataset

Project Summary

We are using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset from Kaggle and this has various data about top 5000 movies. We will analyse some key variables to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and find the relationship between budget and revenue of the top five thousand movies. 

Based on EDA we can see there is a high correlation between budget and revenue. This is apparent from the scatter plot although we do have some outliers with some movies having a high budget and low revenue and some movies with low budget and high revenue. Using the CDF, we can see 90% of the movies have a budget of less than one hundred million. Regression Analysis also shows a high degree of correlation between Budget and Revenue.
