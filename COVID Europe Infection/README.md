COVID Europe Infection

Project Summary

In this project we are going to use COVID 19 Infection dataset and analyse the COVID 19 Pandemic and its influence in the Europe region using the R language. We can use this analysis and use them to extrapolate at the continent level or on a lower level like region. Using the data from the COVID 19 dataset we can then manipulate/transform the data into a uniform format and then use that data to create plots to analyse the course of the COVID 19 Pandemic in various countries. 

We are going to use the above publicly available data for the number of COVID 19 infections in Europe and each row contains the number of new cases and deaths reported per day and per country in Europe and has eleven variables. We then removed the redundant fields and modified the Date in a more usable format.

We can use these existing data and the created plots to create a model to predict the future outcome of the COVID 19 Infection as it spreads throughout Europe. As we can see we have all the necessary information in hand to create a future prediction model based on the Date/Cases/Deaths variables. We can recommend building a model that is based on Logistic modelling and ARIMA model. Using these models, we can calculate the current R value and predict future R value as well.

We can see a clear short spike in the number of Deaths in Apr 2020 when the number of cases is low. That period was the onset of the pandemic in France and hence the more deaths to cases ratio. In Nov 2020 to May 2021 the number of deaths again rise but this time the number of cases is also relatively high where we have started to manage the COVID 19 Pandemic better. In the recent data we can see the number of cases to deaths ratio has come down drastically because of the steps undertaken by various governments.
