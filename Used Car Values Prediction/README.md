Used Car Values Prediction

Project Summary

Companies always have a tough time pricing their products so that they stay competitive and get more customers. This job is even harder for companies that sell used products like cars/laptops/mobile phones etc. The reason is that for new products, the companies would have a complete control of the various components that go into building the product and so we can add the requisite profit margin and price the same. But with used products there are a lot of unknowns and hence more difficult to price them competitively and gain an advantage over the competition.

Companies can make use of their historical data and price them but there are multiple variables to choose from and it is a highly time-consuming process. We also need to keep updating the historical data year by year and price the products that come to the companies accordingly. Here is where Data Mining would help these companies a lot as once the model is trained and evaluated, we can use that to price the incoming products a lot easier and without wasting a lot of time.

We will first drop the less useful features and then covert the other features to a standard format. Then we create dummy variables for the categorical variables and replace the missing values with the median value. 

Random Forest Regression model works well compared to Linear Regression and we will continue using that model for future predictions.
