Weather Application

Project Summary

In this project we are creating a weather application in Python that takes city or zip code to look up weather data and display the weather properties of the same. We use the public key from openweathermap website to process the input city or zip code. We can retrieve the temperature values in Celsius or Fahrenheit or Kelvin and the application would keep on looping to get more inputs of city or zip code. The following information is displayed back to the user.
