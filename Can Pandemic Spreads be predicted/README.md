Can Pandemic Spreads be predicted?

Project Summary

In this project we discuss about pandemics and whether the spread of them can be predicted by models and existing software.

First, we define what is a pandemic and how it spreads. Pandemic is a global disease outbreak and infects more people than endemics. Even a single person can spread the infection globally as we saw with the case of COVID 19 Pandemic. The spread is dependent on numerous factors, and we dive deep into them to learn how it happens.

We then discuss why Pandemic spreads are exponential like how when money doubles every 3 days, we get a million in 60 days. Exponential Growth Bias is the feeling that people underestimate how fast the spread increases so quickly. Then we also discuss about how different quarantine methods would contain the spread.

R - Reproduction Number - Measures the spread of infection in a population. If R is above 1 then pandemic is spreading and if it is below 1 then pandemic is shrinking.

We then discuss about the more prominent Pandemic Spread models and how it calculates the pandemic spread and how we can use that information to develop more appropriate quarantine methods. 

There was a nifty tool that was developed during the COVID 19 Pandemic - MicroCOVID project that calculates the user's probability of contracting COVID. The risk is measured in microCOVIDs that is defined as a one in a million chance of becoming infected with COVID.
