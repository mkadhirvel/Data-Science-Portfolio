Airline Safety

Project Summary

There has been widespread media coverage that flying via airlines are not safe anymore and this has caused air travel to subside in USA. In this project we assume the position of a Data Analyst in Southwest Airlines and creating both internal and external campaigns to assure the public that airline travel is safe in-spite of contrary media coverage. I am using Power BI to create the various visualizations used in the project.

First we prepare a Project Dashboard for our internal team and create visualizations that are at an analytical level as our fellow analysts can easily comprehend the same. We infer via data that the number of incidents and fatalities of airlines are lower than that of Auto industry. Even in the airlines industry USA airlines are far better in terms of safety and reliability over the decades.

Once we have approval from the internal team, we create an Executive Summary presentation for the management team and now we create visualizations that are easily understandable as the target audience is the management team. The visualizations used here are Line Charts and Stacked Bar Charts as they are easier to understand.

Now that the management team has approved our internal campaign we move on to the external campaigns and the first one we do is a blog post. This blog post is our first foray into direct consumers and we present the blog from a perspective of being the data analytics team of our airlines. The data now is more holistic and the visualizations are clustered bar charts and clustered column charts that the public can understand.

Then we create an Infographic which can be used as flyers to be provided to consumers and hence these need to be eye-catching with more visuals that are the easier to understand. So we have used pie charts as that is one of the most easily understandable visualization.

The final deliverable is the Video Presentation where we combine the best of all the visualizations used till now and create a solid presentation that disproves the media coverage once and for all that traveling via Southwest Airlines are a safer option compared to all other mode of transports and airlines.
